### Creative Writing 
The internet is a hell-hole of humanity's most depraved desires self-reflected in form a black mirrored digital hell matrix. But GOD DAMN is it fun. [Welcome to the Internet](https://youtu.be/k1BneeJTDcU) Is the best representation of what the internet holds today. How is this information shaping our world? America might have been the top cultural melting-pot for a period of time. However what happens when our World's current cultures are exposed to unlimited consumption of information? How does this affect our youth, who seem to be far more literate with current social technologies then my peers. Peers that have grown up at the start of the digital age. And what does this mean for seemingly dated forms of governing? Beats me, I like ShtPosting on twitter.

## Q & A
1. What was helpful during Onboarding working remotely?
    > The almost 24 hour assistance from the AwesomeInk Staff. It's a big help when you have a burning question and can get a helping hand in a relatively short amount of time.
2. What hindered your progress during Onboarding?
    > Self doubt, 90% of it feels like a mental game. Having to deal with doubtful thoughts like, "Am I cut out for this?" and "It's a simple problem why is this so hard for me to understand", or "This is the 5th night in a row I've ordered pizza. I think I have a problem". It can be overwhelming at times.
3. How did you overcome challenges during Onboarding?

## Self Reflection
1. What do we want to keep doing?
    > I want to keep trying. For as long as I could remember, ever since watching my older sibling hook the Nintendo 64 up to a tv. Technology has peaked my interest.
2. What do we want to stop doing?
    > Worrying, I don't want learning something new to be as stressful as it has been in the past. They say leasons get harder as you get older but I still find learning the first time to be hardest despite age.
3. What do we want to write into our DNA and do forever?
    >Last blog OnboardingSprint3 I wrote. "Healthy Habits" This time around I would say Balance, I feel those two things go hand'n hand. You can't really have healthy habits if they are not balanced with one another. 
4. What do we want to tell our "prior to Bootcamp" self? 
    >You're gonna wanna learn how to meal prep, the pizza deliverly guy knows you personaly now.


#### SideNotes:

If I could have a cabin in the Smokey Mountins with high speed internet and a small garden. That's all I really want in life.
