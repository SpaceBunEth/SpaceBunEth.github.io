## Q & A

1. What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play in the process of rendering content and providing user experience?
    > I think it's pretty cool, not much I can say other then that.  For years I've always wanted to make some form of game, app, or piece of software that I could personally use day to day. To see the capabilities HTML, CSS, and Javascript bring to web-design inspire me to educate myself and see what software I can develop to benifit myself and others.

2. What are some objects that your blog incorporates?
    >   Objects? I keep thinking about Javascript objects. But as I read more into the bootcamp #help channel I think I understand. My blog as of right now is writen in markdown .md files, in some .md files I use maybe one or two HTML elements to better format my blog. As well as some CSS to give my blog more of an artistic feel. No Javascript though, some HTML and CSS objects I've used are...
    
    HTML
    ```
    <br />
    <h3>
    <style>
    ``` 
    CSS
    ```
    body {
        background-color: example;
        color: example;
        font-size: 20px;
    }

    img {
        border: 1px solid black;
    }
    ```

3. What are your thoughts on pseudocoding?
    > I've always tried to cowboy code. That's just how I thought all the devs did it. I knew what pseudocude was, but never knew how to succesfully integrate it into my work flow or really know how to use it. Being able to write out the logic in a language I can pretty much use to write the same program in any high level programming language is pretty cool.

## Self Reflection 

1. What do we want to keep doing?
    > I want to keep learning and growing my skills as a developer.
2. What do we want to stop doing?
    > I want to stop second guessing myself and my abilities. To stand confidintly in my desisions. To shed embarrassment and ask for help when I need it.
3. What do we want to write into our DNA and do forever?
    > Healthy habits, not just with programming but with all aspects of life.
4. What do we want to tell our "prior to Bootcamp" self?
    > Don't trip so hard on wanting to know all the answers.

### SideNote:
###### Sep 11, 2022
Recently moved in with some loved ones. Their closer to the city and live near the bootcamp. It's not the first time I've lived in/ near a city. Last year I was in Nashville, the year before that just outside of Louisville. I can't say I enjoy moving too much, but at the same time I find myself not really wanting to stay in the same spot for too long either. I think that's what's cool about the digital age. No matter where I go, my ditail belongings are a connection away. Sad in a dystopian way, a true digital nomad, but conforting in a way to have something familiar, always at my figure tips. With a world that seems to change day to day, hour by hour, minute by minute. Is it so bad to have alittle piece of ditial sanctuary?
