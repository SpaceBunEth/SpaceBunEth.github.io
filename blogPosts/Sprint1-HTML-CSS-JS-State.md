## Creative Writing
What is SpaceBun about? Is it a web3 project, a art project, a music project? All three are correct but the idea of SpaceBun runs much deeper. I want SpaceBun to be something that allows for creativity to flourish. Though it may never be known by the greater world. If it can accomplish that for me personally, to be used as a tool for creativity. Then maybe it'll do the same for others. One aspect of SpaceBun I want to keep true is this idea of creating something new from nothing. Starting with the most basic of basic a pencil scetch. A doodle. Breathing life into that doodle, giving it a name, a personality, expanding the lore through different mediums of story telling. Whether that be music, art, cooking, any form of art. My definition for art is very lenient. Art is anything anyone puts their mind to for the sake of creation. Keep this concept in mind. We as humans carry a unique ability to produce to must novel of novelty itself.

What role does SpaceBun plan to take on in the information age? How does the concept of a business and practices to produce profit play into this idea? Is money a necessary evil of the world? Or is humanity ready to move past archaic concepts like capitalism and other "ism" that only seem to limit and oppress our loving natures. What does it mean to be completely sovereign and can infrastructure for world peace ever be achievable without oppression of our fellow man?

## Q & A

1. What is the number one thing that held you back this week? Why?
    > Asking for help. Well I can say I found my efforts of muscling through the challenges and blockers I've came across this week. I still find it hard to put my feelings aside and ask for help. [Something In The Way](https://youtu.be/4VxdufqB9zg) Call it tortured artist, middle child syndrome, whatever. Putting myself out there as always been a struggle. Not to give excuses, but highlighting my inner challenges as I go further into the bootcamp. A goal of mine is to put these inner feelings of inadequacy to bed and be unapologetically who I am.
2. What is one thing you would like to learn more about regarding JavaScript (JSON, Data Structures), Bootstrap, or Atomic Design?
    > I think Atomic Design has caught my interest. I've always wondered how complex machines, programs, and structures could be planned and exicuted by man. To understand that complexity can be broken down in simple elements. Down to the basic "Atom" or single componate. Breaths a new excitement into the idea of creating complex projects with the skills I currently have.
3. How does In-Person Bootcamp compare to Remote Onboarding?
    > In-Person 100% all the way. I do have to say, Awesome Ink's vetting process for bootcamp students is a great show of character for the company. Every individual within the fall bootcamp of 2022 is has a bright eager mind willing to explore and learn with no behavioral issues to speak of. I'm very proud to be apart of this group and looking forward to what I can learn from my peers. 
4. What is your “Why”?
    > My "Why"? My responsibilities are not great. I do not have mouths to feed and my family is a very loving and supportive one, and wish nothing more then for my happiness. However my "Why" is one that is deeply dependent upon my dreams. Learning these skills is necessary for the development of my ideas and creativity. The burden of being an artist, if I do not create my visions. No one will.  


#### SideNote: 
Hoping to work even harder this week. Looking forward to spending long days at Awesome Ink.
