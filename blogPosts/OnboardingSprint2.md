# Onboarding Sprint 2

## Q & A

- What is something you wish you could do but currently do not have the coding skills to accomplish?
> Write a full HTML Document from memory. As of right now I find myself frequently googling/ using w3 reference for tags/ html elements. While I know memorizing every HTML tag is a huge undertaking. My goal is obtain enough knowlegde to write a basic HTML Doc. from memory. Using and understanding basic HTML fundimentals such as: <br />
> `<meta> <html> <a> <ul> <audio> <iframe> <script> <span>` To name a few.
- What are you struggling with?
> While I feel like I have a basic understanding of CSS, I feel I have only scratched the surface of HTML and could greatly benefit from taking more time to study how html elements affact one another and how semantic HTML can be more affectivly used to create a better user experence.
- How do you solve a problem? 
> Cry... A lot.
> I start with a google search, then w3, and when all else fails Stock Overflow. That's a joke. I don't use Stock Overflow.
- What methods do you use to help yourself get unstuck?
> It helps to first break down the problem. Understand what it is I am trying to accomplish. Then retrace my steps right before the problem occurs. From there, for me, it is a matter of troubleshooting/ diagnosing what the actual error or problem is. EX:

> - Is this a syntax or spelling error?
> - Are there forces outside of the scope, that could be affecting this issue?
> - Am I following the principles of being a Pragmatic Programmer?
> - Cry
> - Use Stock Overflow
