<!-- ## Q & A 
- Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?<br />
    > A lot of reading for sure, and definitely a struggle to manage time and learning with the given time frame. But not so bad.<br /><br />
    
- What are you excited or eager to learn more about?<br />
    > I'm most excited to learn about JS Framework React, to me that was the main incentive to join AwesomeInk's Bootcamp. My goal is to understand and develop artistic and dynamic webpages for users to enjoy.<br /><br />

- What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?<br />
    > I make music, sometimes.<br /><br />
